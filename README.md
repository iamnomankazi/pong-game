# Pong Game Using Pygame

Developed this classic Pong game using Python's Pygame library. 
Players control paddles on either side using the keyboard: W and S for the left, Up and Down arrows for the right. The game features a clean 800x600 pixel window and displays the score to determine the winner.
I'm planning to add exciting features like an AI opponent that learns to play and challenge players!
